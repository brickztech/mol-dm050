Technical Description

This project is a frontend application built with React and TypeScript, designed to convert natural language queries into SQL statements. It leverages a modern JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, utilizing a variety of libraries for UI, state management, utility functions, and developer tooling.

### Core Libraries and Their Functionalities

#### UI & Styling

- **React**: The foundational library for building user interfaces using a component-based approach.
- **@mui/material, @mui/icons-material, @mui/joy, @mui/system, @mui/material-nextjs**: These are part of the Material UI suite, providing a comprehensive set of pre-built, customizable UI components, icon sets, and advanced styling solutions for React applications.
- **@emotion/react, @emotion/styled**: Libraries for writing CSS-in-JS, enabling dynamic and themeable styling for React components.
- **@mui/x-data-grid**: A powerful data grid component for displaying and interacting with tabular data.
- **@mui/x-date-pickers**: Provides advanced date and time picker components.
- **framer-motion**: Enables smooth animations and transitions within React components.
- **react-markdown, remark-gfm**: Used for rendering Markdown content in React, with support for GitHub Flavored Markdown (tables, strikethrough, etc.).
- **react-syntax-highlighter**: Adds syntax highlighting to code blocks rendered in the UI.
- **react-toastify**: Provides toast notifications for user feedback and alerts.

#### State Management & Utilities

- **zustand**: A minimal, fast, and scalable state management library for React.
- **immer**: Facilitates working with immutable state in a more ergonomic way.
- **copy-to-clipboard**: Utility for copying text to the clipboard programmatically.
- **zod**: TypeScript-first schema validation library, used for validating and parsing data structures.

#### Routing

- **react-router, react-router-dom**: Libraries for handling client-side routing and navigation in React applications.

#### Development & Build Tooling

- **vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
- **@vitejs/plugin-react, vite-plugin-svgr**: Vite plugins to enhance React support and allow importing SVGs as React components.
- **typescript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code quality and maintainability.
- **eslint, @eslint/js, eslint-plugin-react-hooks, eslint-plugin-react-refresh, typescript-eslint**: Tools and plugins for enforcing code quality, linting, and best practices.
- **@types/react, @types/react-dom, @types/react-syntax-highlighter**: TypeScript type definitions for React and related libraries.
- **globals**: Provides a list of recognized global variables for linting and static analysis.
